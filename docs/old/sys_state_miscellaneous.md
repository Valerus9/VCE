## Miscellaneous stuff that lives in the `sys` namespace

### Dates

The few simple types required to work with dates can be found in the `date_interface.hpp` header. There, there are two types of dates defined. First we have the `absolute_time_points`. Generally speaking there should only ever be two of these, namely the
```
absolute_time_point start_date;
absolute_time_point end_date;
```
members of the `sys::state` object. The two store the full dates that are required to turn the compact dates we work with internally into ordinary-looking dates for the ui. Generally, unless the ui (or reading dates out of a text file) is involved in some way, there should be no need to use these member variables either in most places. You can construct an `absolute_time_point` with the help of the `year_month_day` struct as `sys::absolute_time_point{sys::year_month_day{Y, M, D}}`, which will produce an an absolute time point representing the given year (Y), month (M), and day (D).

Most dates that the program will use are encoded by the `date` struct, which internally stores the date as a number of days after the `start_date`. Dates can be operated on directly in these terms. You can construct a date from an integer, representing the number of days after the start date, and you can add integers to a date, thereby adjusting it that many days (this is how durations should typically be calculated, by advancing the date 30 days for a month or 365 days for a year, even if this doesn't advance the user-friendly date by exactly one month or one year). You can also construct dates with the help of the `year_month_day` and the absolute starting date. For example `sys::date{sys::year_month_day{Y, M, D}, start_date}` will result in a `date` representing the given year (Y), month (M), and day (D).

Finally, the convenience function `bool is_playable_date(date d, absolute_time_point start, absolute_time_point end)` is a quick way of testing whether a `date` falls within the playable range of the game.
